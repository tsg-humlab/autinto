Appended constructions
----------------------

Sentences may be followed by unaccented words that do not belong to the sentence proper. There are two kinds of such appended constructions. In one case, the words are simply included in the IP, and there is no pause between them and the last word of the sentence proper. They are treated in section 7.1, where they are referred to as 'tagged constructions'. In a second type, the appended construction forms a separate IP, even though it has no accent. In this case, there is a clear prosodic break separating it from the preceding word. They are treated in section 7.2, as Accentless IPs.
