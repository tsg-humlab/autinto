H\*L close to H\*L
------------------

It may happen that a non-final H\*L is so close to the next H\*L that it is not very clear whether the non-final H\*L actually falls, or whether there is no L between the H\*'s. In such cases, the contour may still sound like a sequence of two H\*L's, and so we still transcibe H\*L H\*L L%. In section [1.7 Downstep with spreading](fall7.htm) we will learn contours with single H\*'s. Here is an example with two H\*L pitch accents on one word.
