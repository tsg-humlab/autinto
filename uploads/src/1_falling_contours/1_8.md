Pre-nuclear H\*LH
-----------------

The nuclear contour H\*L H% has a pre-nuclear version in which the boundary H% no longer functions as a boundary tone, but occurs just before the next pitch accent. Compare the pronunciation of the following example

<div class="audio-example" onclick="play_sound('../audio/c18_1')"><img alt="Play audio" src="../audio.gif" /><img alt="Audio example" src="../audio/gif/c18_1.gif"/></div>

in which "In Amerika" and "doen ze dat anders" are two IPs, with a pronunciation in which only single IP occurs:

<div class="audio-example" onclick="play_sound('../audio/c18_2')"><img alt="Play audio" src="../audio.gif" /><img alt="Audio example" src="../audio/gif/c18_2.gif"/></div>

The medial %L has disappeared, but these two contours are really equivalent, except for the absence of the medial IP-boundary in the second example, which causes H% to be timed like the L of H\*L: it moves to the right, causing a gradual rise. The L now occurs immediately after H\*.

The distance between the accents is larger in the following example, showing the gradual rise quite clearly.

<div class="audio-example" onclick="play_sound('../audio/044cd')"><img alt="Play audio" src="../audio.gif" /><img alt="Audio example" src="../audio/gif/044cd.gif"/></div>

When the first accent is pronounced with H\*L, we get a gradual fall, as usual. Notice that the intonation pattern is quite different.

Here is another example of an early pronunciation of the L in a pre-nuclear H\*LH.
