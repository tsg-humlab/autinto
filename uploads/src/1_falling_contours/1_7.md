Downstep with spreading
-----------------------

Frequently, downstepped patterns are pronounced somewhat differently.

Listen to the following example.

<div class="audio-example" onclick="play_sound('../audio/115')"><img alt="Play audio" src="../audio.gif" /><img alt="Audio example" src="../audio/gif/115.gif"/></div>

In this example, the high pitch for each H\* is extended until just before the next downstepped H\*, causing a terrace-shaped contour, with the beginning of each level of the terrace marking an accented syllable. This is known as **spreading** of H\*. Notice that only non-final H\*'s are spread in this type of contour.

Don't expect to see perfectly terraced contours in naturally spoken utterances. Often, they just seem to slither down, even though the auditory impression is that of accents stepping down.

<div class="audio-example" onclick="play_sound('../audio/114')"><img alt="Play audio" src="../audio.gif" /><img alt="Audio example" src="../audio/gif/114.gif"/></div>

Compare with the same utterance which is also downstepped, but without spreading:

<div class="audio-example" onclick="play_sound('../audio/128')"><img alt="Play audio" src="../audio.gif" /><img alt="Audio example" src="../audio/gif/128.gif"/></div>

Downstepped contours with spreading can also end with % or H%, as in the following examples:

<div class="audio-example" onclick="play_sound('../audio/321')"><img alt="Play audio" src="../audio.gif" /><img alt="Audio example" src="../audio/gif/321.gif"/></div>

<div class="audio-example" onclick="play_sound('../audio/319')"><img alt="Play audio" src="../audio.gif" /><img alt="Audio example" src="../audio/gif/319.gif"/></div>

Here are some more examples, with varying numbers of accents. The first has three accents. Notice that the last one does not fall to fully low pitch, and we therefore transcribe it as a half-completed, downstepped H\*L. The second example has two accents, and ends with fully low pitch.

<div class="audio-example" onclick="play_sound('../audio/116')"><img alt="Play audio" src="../audio.gif" /><img alt="Audio example" src="../audio/gif/116.gif"/></div>

<div class="audio-example" onclick="play_sound('../audio/157')"><img alt="Play audio" src="../audio.gif" /><img alt="Audio example" src="../audio/gif/157.gif"/></div>

**Low pitch on !H\***

The pitch of the final downstepped H\* is usually very low, and may vary between just above fully low or fully low, without any difference in effect. In all such cases, we transcribe !H\*, even though the final accented syllable may be pronounced with fully low pitch.

This is the case in the next example, for instance. The word "huis" has fully low pitch; equivalently, it might have had a fall from mid to low, but all such contours have the same transcription.

<div class="audio-example" onclick="play_sound('../audio/049')"><img alt="Play audio" src="../audio.gif" /><img alt="Audio example" src="../audio/gif/049.gif"/></div>

**Missing the last !H\*L**

When the last accent falls on the phrase-final word, it is often overlooked and misheard as low, unaccented pitch. This is "frequent error #2". In the following two examples, the final syllables "pot" and "uit" have downstepped !H\*L's.

<div class="audio-example" onclick="play_sound('../audio/122')"><img alt="Play audio" src="../audio.gif" /><img alt="Audio example" src="../audio/gif/122.gif"/></div>

<div class="audio-example" onclick="play_sound('../audio/121')"><img alt="Play audio" src="../audio.gif" /><img alt="Audio example" src="../audio/gif/121.gif"/></div>

In particular when the accents occur on the last syllable, as in the above examples, the !H\*L's are mistaken for lack of accent because they are low-pitched. When we lengthen the utterances, it is in fact easier to hear the accents.

<div class="audio-example" onclick="play_sound('../audio/123')"><img alt="Play audio" src="../audio.gif" /><img alt="Audio example" src="../audio/gif/123.gif"/></div>

<div class="audio-example" onclick="play_sound('../audio/124')"><img alt="Play audio" src="../audio.gif" /><img alt="Audio example" src="../audio/gif/124.gif"/></div>

Here are three examples: "tegen", "dier" and "uit" are accented.

<div class="audio-example" onclick="play_sound('../audio/030a')"><img alt="Play audio" src="../audio.gif" /><img alt="Audio example" src="../audio/gif/030a.gif"/></div>

<div class="audio-example" onclick="play_sound('../audio/030b')"><img alt="Play audio" src="../audio.gif" /><img alt="Audio example" src="../audio/gif/030b.gif"/></div>

<div class="audio-example" onclick="play_sound('../audio/125')"><img alt="Play audio" src="../audio.gif" /><img alt="Audio example" src="../audio/gif/125.gif"/></div>
