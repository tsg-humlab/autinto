Types of rises
--------------

We distinguish two classes of rising pitch accents, based on the pitch of the beginning of the rise in the accented syllable. On this basis, we distinguish high rises and low rises.

Low rises come in a number of kinds. The high rise is introduced in the next section.

Example:

<div class="audio-example" onclick="play_sound('../audio/c51_a')"><img alt="Play audio" src="../audio.gif" /><img alt="Audio example" src="../audio/gif/c51_a.gif"/></div>
