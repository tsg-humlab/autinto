Low low rise
------------

The last type of low rise is one which continues the low pitch of the accented syllable until the end of the IP, where H% is used. We accordingly transcribe L\* H%. Frequently, the pitch before the accented syllable is high, usually due to %H.

<div class="audio-example" onclick="play_sound('../audio/209')"><img alt="Play audio" src="../audio.gif" /><img alt="Audio example" src="../audio/gif/209.gif"/></div>

Even though there is no obvious pitch movement in or immediately after the syllable "loe", this syllable is nevertheless accented, and the pitch movement at the end is a boundary tone. It is of course possible to say the same sentence with a rising contour, say L\*H H%, on the final word (and syllable) "veel", with no accent on "loe". But this contour, shown in the next example, sounds different.
