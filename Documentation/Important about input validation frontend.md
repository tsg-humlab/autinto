The validate.js script/code contains the rules to handle user input and display error messages if needed. The filledAnnotations and key arrays are passed to 
it, filledAnnotations will contain the pre filled annotations and the annotations filled by the user, the key will have the correct answer with the pre filled annotations. 
Note that when the user chooses nothing it will be an empty string in the filled annotations array. The key array will contain the correct answer, based on the combination of 
the of key and filledAnnotations those rules can be made and new cases can be added. With the rules we implemented, it is easy to correspond the code to the rule, 
they are if-statements that if triggered will return (and then display) an error message. 
The rules we have now cover the obvious cases but there are edge cases that fail. Due to time constraints, we could not test for all cases and 
extend/adjust the code accordingly.
