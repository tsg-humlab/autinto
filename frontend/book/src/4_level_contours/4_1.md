Types of level contours
-----------------------

The most common nuclear level contour is simply referred to as the level tone, and transcribed H\* %. In addition to this high or mid level tone, we discuss two less frequent tone, the vocative chant, H\* !H %, which consists of two or more level pitches, and the low level ('scathing', L\* %). In section 5.5 we continue the discussion of level tones with the prenuclear uses of H\* and L\*.
