Overview of symbols and conventions
-----------------------------------

In the ToDI transcription system, an intonation contour is a melodic pattern which occurs in an Intonational Phrase. Each contour consists of a number of tones, **H**(igh) and **L**(ow). The notation T is used to refer to either H or L. These tones occur in two locations:

1.  at the edges of Intonational Phrases
2.  at accented syllables

Intonational Phrases are demarcated by %. Not every edge will have a tone. Tones occurring at IP edges are notated %T (initial boundary tone) or T% (final boundary tone). Every accented syllable is marked by a tone or a cluster of tones, called a 'pitch accent'. The first tone of a pitch accent is notated T\*. A T\* may be followed by further tones to describe the movement from the accented syllable onward.

Here is an example:

All the symbols will be explained in the text. By way of quick reference guide, a list of each element is given, as well as a list of all pitch accents, with approximate indications when they are used.

The melodic shape of the contour is defined by the consecutive contour shapes defined by the boundary tones and the pitch accents.
